# Python Data Analysis and Machine Learning Journey

## Overview

Welcome to my Python learning journey! This Jupyter Notebook documents my progress as I explore various essential steps in a typical data science workflow, from reading a DataFrame to preprocessing and scaling data.

## Notebook Contents

### 1. Data Exploration and Preparation

- **Reading DataFrame:** Started by reading a dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Unique Value Counts:** Explored the dataset and obtained unique value counts.
- **Visualizing Target Variable:** Utilized visualization techniques to understand the distribution of the target variable.

### 2. Data Preprocessing and Splitting

- **Separating X and Y:** Segregated independent and dependent variables.
- **Train-Test Split (70:30):** Split the data into training and testing sets.
- **Frequency Distributions:** Analyzed frequency distributions in both the training and test sets.

### 3. Advanced Scaling Techniques

- **Scaling with StandardScaler:** Explored the impact of standard scaling on the dataset.
- **Scaling with MinMaxScaler:** Investigated the effects of Min-Max scaling.

## Usage

Explore the notebook sequentially to understand the progression of my learning journey. The notebook is extensively documented, with code snippets, explanations, and visualizations to aid comprehension.

## Data

The dataset used in this notebook can be found on Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection. It is a .csv file. Feel free to download and use it for your own learning and experimentation.
